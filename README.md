Welcome to Xsauce! 

Xsauce is a suite of tools that empower the evolution of cultural assets.

Cultural assets, which we define as assets deriving their value from cultural significance rather than a pure measure of utility, represent a valuable, yet small portion of the investable assets that can be traded on centralized exchanges.

Our immediate focus is on hyped or rare sneakers as they represent a unique cultural asset class. Further to this point, sneakers have become a lucrative investment as evidenced through the rapidly growing $10 billion+ sneaker resale market.

As the market currently stands, the typical means of investing in these types of assets is via a managed collection wherein investors can buy shares of a fractionalized asset.

This solution significantly reduces the cost of entry and reduces investor risk, but it overlooks fundamental limitations such as narrow trading windows and liquidity challenges.

We believe that the future of cultural assets will be dynamic. That the value created will grow in tandem with the meaning and creativity which defines culture. We see a future where a select number of assets are released for physical wear/use and the remaining are synthetic counterparts.
